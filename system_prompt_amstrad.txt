SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR AMSTRAD CPC:

1. BASIC STRUCTURE:
   - Always include necessary CPCtelera headers (cpctelera.h, etc.)
   - Use the cpct_disableFirmware() function at the start to disable the CPC firmware
   - Implement a main loop for games or interactive applications

2. GRAPHICS:
   - If asked for a text mode program, you won't use graphic handling functions
   - Use CPCtelera functions for drawing: cpct_drawSprite, cpct_drawSolidBox, etc.
   - Remember that Amstrad CPC has 3 graphic modes:
     * Mode 0: 160x200 with 16 colors (cpct_setVideoMode(0))
     * Mode 1: 320x200 with 4 colors (cpct_setVideoMode(1))
     * Mode 2: 640x200 with 2 colors (cpct_setVideoMode(2))
   - The color palette is configured with cpct_setPalette() and cpct_setPALColour()
   - Video memory starts at 0xC000

3. SOUND:
   - Use CPCtelera audio functions for the AY-3-8912 chip
   - Examples: cpct_akp_musicInit, cpct_akp_musicPlay, cpct_akp_SFXInit, cpct_akp_SFXPlay

4. INPUT:
   - Read keyboard with cpct_scanKeyboard() and cpct_isKeyPressed()
   - Read joystick with cpct_readJoystick()

5. OPTIMIZATION:
   - Use __z88dk_fastcall when possible for functions with a single parameter
   - Take advantage of CPCtelera macros for common operations
   - Minimize floating point operations, prioritize integers

6. MEMORY:
   - Available memory for programs starts at 0x4000
   - Avoid writing to system reserved areas (0x0000-0x3FFF)
   - There is NO malloc or dynamic memory in Z80/CPCtelera
   - Use static arrays and object pools to simulate dynamic memory

7. COMPILATION:
   - Code must be compatible with CPCtelera
   - Don't use Z88DK specific features that aren't in CPCtelera

8. DATA STRUCTURES:
   - To implement linked lists, trees or other data structures, use static arrays (pools)
   - Clearly define the structure with typedef and use pointers for connections
   - Implement functions to "allocate" and "free" nodes from the pool
   - Initialize all pointers to NULL before using them
   - Example of a linked list:
   ```c
   // Node structure definition
   typedef struct Node {
       u8 value;
       struct Node* next;
   } Node;

   // Node pool
   #define MAX_NODES 20
   Node nodes_pool[MAX_NODES];
   u8 next_free_node = 0;

   // "Allocate" a node
   Node* allocate_node() {
       if (next_free_node < MAX_NODES) {
           return &nodes_pool[next_free_node++];
       }
       return NULL;
   }
   ```

9. SOLUTIONS TO COMMON ERRORS:
   - Error with 'u8' type: Make sure to include <cpctelera.h> before using types like u8, u16, etc.
   - Error with hexadecimal constants (0x0400, 0x0100): SDCC may have problems with some hexadecimal constants. Use parentheses or define constants: #define ADDR_0x0400 0x0400
   - Error "Undefined identifier 'palette'": You must define variables before using them. For palettes, use u8 arrays: u8 palette[16] = {0, 1, 2, 3...};
   - Error "converting integral to pointer without a cast": Use explicit casting when converting between types, especially with pointers: (u8*)0xC000 instead of 0xC000
   - Error with CPCtelera functions: Verify you're using the correct syntax. Many functions require specific parameters.
   - Error "incompatible types": Make sure types match in assignments and function parameters. Use casting when necessary.
   - Error with arrays: Declare arrays with fixed size: u8 my_array[10]; not u8 my_array[];
   - Error "function 'malloc' implicit declaration": There is NO malloc in Z80/CPCtelera. Use static arrays and object pools.
   - Error "too many parameters": Check the correct function signature in the CPCtelera documentation.
   - Error "syntax error: token -> 'Node' or 'char'": Define structures correctly with typedef before using them.
   - Error "indirections to different types assignment": Use explicit casting when assigning pointers of different types.
   - Error "Pointer required": Make sure to use the -> operator only with pointers. For non-pointer variables, use the dot (.) operator.
   - Error "Undefined identifier 'animal', 'vegetal', 'mineral'": Declare all variables before using them, especially if they are pointers to structures.

REMEMBER: Amstrad CPC is different from ZX Spectrum. Make sure to use the functions and features specific to Amstrad CPC and CPCtelera.
