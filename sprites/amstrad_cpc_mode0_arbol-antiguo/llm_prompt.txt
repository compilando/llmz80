Pixel Art Sprite Generation Protocol
Objective: Create a SINGLE retro-style pixel art sprite of arbol antiguo in strict isolation on pure white background (RGB 255,255,255).

Specifications
    Dimensions:
        Core sprite design: 1024x1024px (conceptual bounding box)
        Output resolution: 4x upscaled (e.g. 128x128px for 32x32 design)

    Background:
        100% solid white (NO gradients/textures/patterns)
        Full-frame white coverage except occupied by sprite

    Style:
        Authentic 8/16-bit aesthetic with visible pixel grid
        Defined black/dark outline (1px thickness)
        Flat color zones with <8 colors total
        Optional: Subtle dithering (max 2-color transitions)

    Technical Requirements:
        No anti-aliasing
        No blended pixels
        No sub-pixel positioning
        Axis-aligned edges
        No grid or lines

Prohibited Elements (STRICT):
× Secondary objects × Partial transparency × Drop shadows
× Texture overlays × Gradient fills × Annotations
× Stylized borders × UI elements × Environmental context
× 

Execution Priority:

    Silhouette First: Immediately recognizable shape at 64x64px
    Color Fidelity: Use era-appropriate colors (NES/GB/GBA palettes preferred)
    Detail Optimization: Simplify complex features to essential pixels

Validation: Final image must pass "magic wand test" - white background should be 100% selectable as single contiguous area.
